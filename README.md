# Introduction

This is my ~/.config/i3 configuration directory.  I have been using I3 for a
little over a week.  At this point, I'm not totally sure that I am going to
stick with it, but I have enjoyed the customization process so far and have
created a very workable environemnt

# Layout

I like the common conf.d directory approach to configuration.  So I have laid
out my configuration in a way that global configs are put in the config file,
and everything else is included via conf.d/*.conf.

# What I'm using

feh - for my background updater
rofi - for dmenu, and a couple other utilities that I wrote.
py3status - for my status bar

Edited i3-save-tree output for desktop layouts. (I tried i3-resurrect because it
solved some of the problems I had with i3-save-tree, but I never got windows to
recover correctly.
